# Crypto Cube

See how bitcoin was riding from 17th of September 2013 (or clone and alter this date, the earliest possible is 2010-07-17) to yeasterday on an animated cube that scales according to BTC/USD rates day by day. 

See it working at [https://marianpekar.github.io/crypto-cube/](https://marianpekar.github.io/crypto-cube/)

*This microproject is powered by THREE.js*. In case you've never heard of this JS library, I suggest you to visit [threejs.org](https://threejs.org/) where you can find more about this awesome library plus a lot of way much cooler examples of usage than in this humble repository.

Bitcoin prices are fetched from [CoinDesk Bitcoin Price Index API](https://www.coindesk.com/api).
